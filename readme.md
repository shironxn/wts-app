This project is the result of my exercise in learning Typescript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It demonstrates how to use Typescript to create a weather app that fetches weather data and geocoding information from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The app is designed to enhance my Typescript and OOP skills while building a practical application.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository URL>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd wts-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Rename file `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in the `API_KEY` with your [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) inside the `.env` file.
3. Build the Typescript code: `npm run build`
4. Run the built code: `npm start`
5. For development, you can use: `npm run dev`

## Features

- Retrieve weather data from [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Fetch geocoding data using [OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api).

Feel free to explore and learn from this project as you dive into Typescript and OOP concepts. Enjoy coding!
